# Sudoku-Solver
This python file contains a Sudoku board (represented as a 2D list of integers) that is solved when the `solve` function is called.
###### Note: The board treats 0 as empty squares to be filled in.

The solve function uses a recursive backtracking approach to solving the Sudoku puzzle.
